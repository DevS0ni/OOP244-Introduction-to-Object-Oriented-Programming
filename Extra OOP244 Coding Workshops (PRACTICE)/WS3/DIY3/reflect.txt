WorkShop 1 Part 1 (LAB) :
-------------------------

For the Workshop Part 1, the concepts which concerned with the execution of the workshop part-1 were about Member Functions and Privacy, Encapsulation of the data; Dynamic Memory Allocation of the objects and of the member variables of the class. The thing which I learnt the most was how class in C++, is different as compared to the structures. In addition to this, the class is regulated by access modifiers: private(default for member variables), public, and protected, this ensures encapsulation of the program and data. Implementation of member functions to make a modular program.

WorkShop 2 Part 2 (DIY) :
-------------------------

For the workshop Part 2, the concepts which I learnt were the same what I used to do in the workshop 1. The only additional section in this workshop was the additional Dynamic Allocation check, at the end of the program.
