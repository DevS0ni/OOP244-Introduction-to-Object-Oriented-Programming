Your task for the project for this semester is to create an application that keeps track of a Valet Parking that can park Cars and Motorcycles in a parking and retrieve them back when requested. 

## Milestones due dates
This project will be done in 5 milestones and each milestone will have its due date. The due date of each milestone is stated below, and it is based on the amount of work to be done for that milestone. 

## Final project mark

> To make the final submission of the project easier and to make it possible to partially submit a project we have divided the submission of milestone 5 into six small ones. Each submission is worth 10% of the project mark. Your project will be marked only if you have all four milestones and at least have one of the 6 six submissions of milestone 5. 

You can check the due date of each milestone using the ```-due``` flag in the submission command:
```bash
~profname.proflastname/submit 2??/prj/m? -due
```
- replace **2??** with the subject code
- replace **m?** with the milestone number
> Different sections may have different due dates based on their section's progress. Always check the due date using this command. The due date returned by this command always have priority over the due dates stated above.
## Citation, Sources

When submitting your work, all the files submitted should carry full student information along with the "citation and sources" information. See the following example:

If you have multiple submissions of the same milestone, please update the Revision History in each submission so your professor knows what changes to look for.

```

**Failing to include the above citation to any of the files containing your work will cause the rejection of your project submission**

#### See below for details:

### For work that is done entirely by you (ONLY YOU)

If the file contains only your work or the work provided to you by your professor, add the following message as a comment at the top of the file:

> I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my project milestones.

### For work that is done partially by you.

If the file contains work that is not yours (you found it online or somebody provided it to you), **write exactly which part of the assignment is given to you as help, who gave it to you, or which source you received it from.**  By doing this you will only lose the mark for the parts you got help for, and the person helping you will be clear of any wrongdoing.


> :warning: This [Submission Policy](#submission-policy) only applies to the project. All other assessments in this subject have their own submission policies.

### If you have helped someone with your code

If you have helped someone with your code. Let them know of these regulations and in an email write exactly which part of your code was copied and who was the recipient of this code.<br />By doing this you will be clear of any wrongdoing if the recipient of the code does not honour these regulations.

## Compiling and Testing Your Program

All your code should be compiled using this command on `matrix`:

```bash
g++ -Wall -std=c++11 -g -o ms file1.cpp file2.cpp ...
```

- `-Wall`: the compiler will report all warnings
- `-std=c++11`: the code will be compiled using the C++11 standard
- `-g`: the executable file will contain debugging symbols, allowing *valgrind* to create better reports
- `-o ms`: the compiled application will be named `ms`

After compiling and testing your code, run your program as follows to check for possible memory leaks (assuming your executable name is `ms`):

```bash
valgrind --show-error-list=yes --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --track-origins=yes ms
```

- `--show-error-list=yes`: show the list of detected errors
- `--leak-check=full`: check for all types of memory problems
- `--show-leak-kinds=all`: show all types of memory leaks identified (enabled by the previous flag)
- `--track-origins=yes`: tracks the origin of uninitialized values (`g++` must use `-g` flag for compilation, so the information displayed here is meaningful).

To check the output, use a program that can compare text files.  Search online for such a program for your platform, or use *diff* available on `matrix`.


### Adding alias to `.bash_profile` on matrix
You can add the following two lines to the end of your `.bash_profile` file in your matrix home directory to create two aliases for the above C++ compilation and valgrind testing so you don't have to type such a long command to compile and execute your programs:
```bash
alias msc++="g++ -Wall -std=c++11 -g -o ms"
alias vrun="valgrind --show-error-list=yes --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --track-origins=yes"
```
By adding the above to the '.bash_profile' (you must logoff and log back it so it takes effect) you can compile your c++ files as follows:
```bash
msc++ file1.cpp file2.cpp file3.cpp...<ENTER>
```
The above will compile your files and if successful it will create an executable called `ms`.
```bash
vrun ms<ENTER>
```
The above will execute your `ms` executable under the tester `valgrind` for detailed test on leaks and runtime errors.

> Note: All the code written in this project must be implemented in the **sdds** namespace, unless instructed otherwise.

> Make sure that all the debugging code and debugging comments are removed before submission.

## Project Implementation notes:  *Very Important, read carefully*
- All the code written in this project should be within the namespace sdds.

- You are free and encouraged to add any attributes(member variables), functions and methods (member functions) you find necessary to complete your code. If you are not sure about your strategy for adding functionalities and properties to your classes, ask your professor for advice.  

- If any methods are being added and they are not called outside the scope of the class, make sure they are private.

- Unless you are asked for a specific definition, name the variables, and functions yourself. Use proper names and follow the naming conventions instructed by your professor. Having meaningless and misleading names will attract a penalty.

- When creating methods (member functions) make sure to make them constant if in their logic, they are not modifying their class.

- When passing an object or variable by address or reference, if they are not to be modified, make sure they are passed as constant pointers and references.

- If an Empty state is required for an object, it is considered to be an “invalid” empty state, and objects in this state should be rendered unusable.

- A module called **Utils** is added to the project that can be used for your custom functions and classes in your implementation. Leave this module empty if you don't have any custom functionalities. <br />
You can add any custom code/class of your own to the **Utils** module to be used throughout the project. 

- Throughout the project, if any class is capable of displaying or writing itself, the member function will always have the following signature: 
The function will return a reference of an **ostream** and will receive a reference on an **ostream** as an optional argument. If this argument is not provided, the object “**cout**” will be passed instead. 

- Throughout the project, if any class is capable of reading or receiving its content from a stream, the member function will always have the following signature: 
The function will return a reference of an **istream** and will receive a reference on an **istream** as an optional argument. If this argument is not provided, the object “**cin**” will be passed instead. 

- When passing an object or variable by address or reference, if they are not to be modified, make sure they are passed as constant pointers and references.

- You may reuse and copy any code your professor provided for your workshops or functions you may have from previous work in this subject or other subjects and place it in the Utils module. 

# The Project; Valet Parking Application

We will start the development of the project by creating its user interface (MS1, Menu system). Then we will create a mockup application that represents what the application will look like and act without actually doing anything(MS2 Parking app). In short, we are creating a prototype of the application (in ms1 and ms2) then coding its engine (in ms3 and ms4) and finally adding functionality to Parking (ms2) to make it fully functional (in ms5).

# Milestone 1
## The Menu Module

This Module contains two classes; MenuItem and Menu. MenuItem is a fully private class owned by the Menu Class (Menu is a friend of MenuItem). Therfore, Only the Menu class can construct and use the MenuItem and because of this the two classes reside in the same module.

## Purpose:

Menu displays a menu title and several menu items with a row number attached to each, and lets the user make a selection. After user makes the selection, the row number of the selected menu item is returned to the caller program. 

## The MenuItem class:

Create a fully private class (no public members) called MenuItem that is owned by the Menu class. (i.e. Menu is a friend of MenuItem).

To make this possible (since Menu is not yet implemented), forward declare the Menu class to be able to make it a friend of MenuItem class.

MenuItem can hold a C-style character string with a maximum length of 50 as its content. Any attempt to set the content to more than 50 characters should store the truncated value instead (down to 50 characters). 

### Construction:

Menuitem can be created by a constant C-style character string to be used to set its content. If the provided string is invalid (null) then the object is set to an Empty state. 

### Member function:
The MenuItem can display itself by writing its content on the screen and printing a new line. 

If MenuItem is in an empty state, nothing is printed. 

### Copy and Assignment:
MenuItem can not get copied or assigned to another MenuItem. This, must be enforced in your code.

### Other member functions:
Add other members to MenuItem if needed during the development of this module 

 
## The Menu class:
Before starting to implement the Menu class, create a constant int value in the Menu module called MAX_NO_OF_ITEMS and set it to 10. 

## Properties: (member variables)
### Title:
Menu can hold a C-style character string with a maximum length of 50 as its title. Any attempt to set the content to more than 50 characters should store the truncated value instead (down to 50 characters). 

### MenuItems: 
The Menu class holds an array of MenuItems with a size of MAX_NO_OF_ITEMS. Throughout the program, as menu items are added to the Menu, the elements of the array are set to individual MenuItems for each addition. 

Make sure you keep track of the number of added MenuItems to the Menu for printing the Menu and item selection validation.

### Indentation: 

When displaying the menu, the title and menu items may be indented to the right. For each indentation level (value of 1) indent the menu 4 spaces to the right. (You can keep this value in an integer attribute)

Menu example without indentation (value of 0):
```text
** The Menu **
1- Option one
2- Option Two
3- Option three
4- Option four
5- Exit
>
```
Menu example with indentation value of 2:
```text
        ** The Menu **
        1- Option one
        2- Option Two
        3- Option three
        4- Option four
        5- Exit
        >
```

### Other properties: 
Add other properties if or when needed. 

### Construction:
A Menu object can be created by a constant C-style character string, to be used to set its title and an optional integer value for indentation. If indentation is not provided, the value “0” will be passed instead.

If the string is invalid (null) then Menu is set to an invalid empty state.

### Copy and Assignment:
Menu can not get copied or assigned to another Menu. This, must be enforced in your code.

### Member functions, operator and cast overloads:

#### bool cast overload
Overload the cast operator so if the Menu object is casted to a bool, it returns true if the Menu is valid and usable, otherwise it returns false if the Menu is in an invalid empty state.

#### isEmpty() function
Write an isEmpty function that returns true if the Menu is in an invalid empty State or false if it is valid and usable.

Note that isEmpty works the opposite of the bool cast overload.

#### display function
The Menu should display itself as follows:

If the Menu is in an invalid empty state, it will print: ```"Invalid Menu!"``` and a new line

If the Menu has no MenuItems, it will print: ```"No Items to display!"``` and a new line

##### Otherwise:

First it will print its title and go to new line.<br />
Then it will display a row number, starting with number one (1) and a dash.<br />
Afterwards it will print a space and then the first MenuItem in the array. <br />
It will continue printing the row numbers and the MenuItems to the number of menu items added to the Menu.<br /> 
At end it will print a greater-than operator (“>”) and a space as the prompt for user selection. 
##### Menu example:
```text
** The Menu **
1- Option one
2- Option Two
3- Option three
4- Option four
5- Exit
> 
```
#### Assignment 
A Menu should be able to be assigned to a constant character C-string. This should reset the title of the Menu to the newly assigned string. If the string is invalid (null) the Menu is set to an invalid empty state.

##### Assignment example:
```C++
Menu lunchMenu("Lunch Menu");
lunchMenu = "New Title"; //<<---- Assignment
```

#### add function: 
write an add function that returns nothing and receives a constant character C-string to build a MenuItem and add it to the MenuItems of the Menu. 

If the string is invalid (null) then the Menu is set to an invalid empty state and nothing is added.

The add function should use the C-string argument to add a MenuItem to the Menu if possible. 

If the MenuItem array is full, then the function should silently ignore the addition and exit. Also, the add function will do nothing and exit silently if the Menu is in an invalid empty state.

#### clear function
This function removes all the menu items and the title and therefore sets the menu to an empty menu.

#### left shift operator overload (“<<”)
Overload the left shift operator to insert a constant character C-string into the Menu as a MenuItem. This overload should work exactly like the add function and work as follows: 

Insertion example to add three MenuItems to the lunchMenu:
```C++
Menu lunchMenu("Lunch Menu");
lunchMenu << "Hamburger" << "Chicken Sandwich" << "Pasta and meatballs";
```

Displaying the above menu should result the following:

```text
Lunch Menu
1- Hamburger
2- Chicken Sandwich
3- Pasta and meatballs
> 
```

Insertion example to add invalid MenuItems to the lunchMenu:
```text
Menu lunchMenu("Lunch Menu");
lunchMenu << nullptr << "Chicken Sandwich" << "Pasta and meatballs";
```
Displaying the above menu should result the following:
```text
Invalid Menu!
```

#### Menu class in action (run function):
Create a function called run that returns an integer. In this function displays the Menu and waits for the user’s response to select an option by entering the row number of the MenuItems. 

If the user enters non-integer value print the following error message: ```"Invalid Integer, try again: "```
 and wait for the user’s response.

If the user enters an integer, but out of the boundary of the available options print the following error message: ```"Invalid selection, try again: "``` and wait for the user’s response.

When user selects a valid option, end the function and return the selected option value.

If the Menu has no MenuItems, no selection is made and 0 returned with no user interaction.

Run function example:

```C++
Menu lunchMenu("Lunch Menu");
lunchMenu << "Hamburger" << "Chicken Sandwich" << "Pasta and meatballs";
int choice = lunchMenu.run();
cout << "You selected " << choice << endl;
```
### Integer cast overload
After creating the run function, overload the cast operator so if the Menu object is casted to an integer, the run function is called, and its value is returned as the integer cast value. 

Integer cast example:
```C++
Menu lunchMenu("Lunch Menu");
lunchMenu << "Hamburger" << "Chicken Sandwich" << "Pasta and meatballs";
int choice = lunchMenu;
cout << "You selected " << choice << endl;
```
#### Other member functions:
Add other member functions to the Menu if needed.

## [Back to milestones](#milestones)

# Milestone 2

## The Parking module:

The parking module is the skeleton of your final project and will be revisited at the final stage of the application development. In milestone 2 you will build the main structure of the application that gives the user all the options needed for managing the Valet Parking. 

For now, when these options are selected you will only print the name of the action. In the following milestones, you will develop the facilities needed to provide the actual requested actions by the user. 

### The Parking module runs as follows:
It loads a data file from the hard disk that holds the information about the parked cars in the Parking. (the actual loading will be implemented in the last milestone) Then it will display the following menu:

```text
Parking Menu, select an action:
1- Park Vehicle
2- Return Vehicle
3- List Parked Vehicles
4- Find Vehicle
5- Close Parking (End of day)
6- Exit Program
>
```
If the user selects the first option, a submenu as follows with one indentation to right will be displayed:

```text
    Select type of the vehicle:
    1- Car
    2- Motorcycle
    3- Cancel
    >
```


### Mock-up messages
For now, print the following messages based on the user's selections:

#### Park Vehicle / Car:

```text
---------------------------------
Parking Car
---------------------------------
```
#### Park Vehicle / Motorcycle:
```text
---------------------------------
Parking Motorcycle
---------------------------------
```
#### Park Vehicle / Cancel:
```text
---------------------------------
Cancelled parking
---------------------------------
```
#### Return Vehicle:
```text
---------------------------------
Returning Vehicle
---------------------------------
```
#### List Parked Vehicles:
```text
---------------------------------
Listing Parked Vehicles
---------------------------------
```
#### Find Vehicle
```text
---------------------------------
Finding a Vehicle
---------------------------------
```
#### Close Parking (End of day):
Selecting this option ends the parking application for the day<br />
If the exit program option is selected first display the message:
```text
This will close the parking; All the vehicles will be removed!
Are you sure? (Y)es/(N)o:
```
And wait for the user to enter either “Y” or “N” (lowercase or uppercase) and exit if the response is yes.

If the user enters an invalid response then print:
```text
Invalid response, only (Y)es or (N)o are acceptable, retry:
```
And repeat until a proper response is entered.

#### Exit Program:

Selecting this option ends the parking application temporarily.<br />
If the exit program option is selected first display the message:
```text
This will terminate the application and save the data!
Are you sure? (Y)es/(N)o:
```
And wait for the user to enter either “Y” or “N” (lowercase or uppercase) and exit if the response is yes.

If the user enters an invalid response then print:
```text
Invalid response, only (Y)es or (N)o are acceptable, retry:
```
And repeat until a proper response is entered.

To accomplish the above Parking module functionality, implement the following:

### The Parking class implementation:
#### Properties: (member variables and objects)
##### Filename:
Parking holds a C-style string with an unknown size to hold the data path and file name of the application. (for example: `"../data/datafile.dat"`)
##### Parking menu: 
Parking has a Menu object for the main menu of the application.

Initialize the Parking Menu with the following (see the constructor for more detail):

- Indentation: `0`
- Parking Menu Title: `"Parking Menu, select an action:"`

And then populate the menu items with the following in the constructor:

```text
"Park Vehicle"
"Return Vehicle"
"List Parked Vehicles"
"Find Vehicle"
"Close Parking (End of day)"
"Exit Program"
```
##### Vehicle Selection menu: 
Parking has a Menu object for the Vehicle selection menu that is displayed as a submenu when option one of the Parking Menu is selected.

Initialize the Vehicle Menu with the following (see the constructor for more detail):

- Indentation: `1`<br />
- Vehicle Menu Title: `"Select type of the vehicle:"`<br />

And then populate the menu items with the following in the constructor

```text
"Car"
"Motorcycle"
"Cancel"
```

##### Other properties: 
Add other properties if, or when needed. 

#### Constructor implementation:
Parking can be created by a constant C-style character string with an unknown size, to be used to set the name of the file and its path. 

If the string is nullptr or empty then Parking is set to an invalid empty state.

Call the Load Data File function (see list of member functions) and if it returns true, then populate the Parking and Vehicle menus. 

If the Load Data File function returns false, then print:

```text
Error in data file<NEWLINE>
```
and set the class to an invalid empty state.
#### Destructor implementation:
- Call the Save Data File function (see list of member functions), and Make sure there is no memory leak when the Parking goes out of scope.

#### Copy and Assignment:
Copy and assignment are denied in the Parking class. (Parking class can not be copied or assigned to another Parking object)

### Private Member function implementations:
For now, these are just mock-up functions that mostly print the messages displayed in the [Mock-up Messages](#mock-up-messages)

#### isEmpty() function
Write an isEmpty function that returns true if the Parking is in an invalid empty State or false if the parking is valid and usable.

#### Parking Status function 
This function does not receive or return anything and at this stage only prints:
```text
****** Valet Parking ******<NEWLINE>
```

#### Park Vehicle function 
This function does not receive or return anything.<br />
The function displays the Vehicle Selection sub-menu. Then based on the user's selection; Car, Motorcycle or Cancel, it will print [the corresponding message](#mock-up-messages). Afterwards, it goes to a new line. 

#### Return Vehicle function 
This function does not receive or return anything and only prints [the corresponding message](#mock-up-messages).

#### List Parked Vehicles function 
This function does not receive or return anything and only prints [the corresponding message](#mock-up-messages).

#### Find Vehicle function 
This function does not receive or return anything and only prints [the corresponding message](#mock-up-messages).

#### Close Parking function 
This function does not receive anything and returns a Boolean.<br />
Follow the instruction in the [Close Parking (End of day)](#close-parking-end-of-day) menu selection and then return true, if the user’s response is Yes. Otherwise, return false if the user’s response is No.

#### Exit Parking App Function 
This function does not receive anything and returns a Boolean.<br />
Follow the instruction in the [Exit program](#exit-program) menu selection and then return true, if the user’s response is Yes. Otherwise, return false if the user’s response is No.

#### Load Data File function 
This function does not receive anything and returns a Boolean.<br />
If the Parking is not in an invalid empty state,  Print the following: `"loading data from "` and then print the name of the data file followed by a `<NEWLINE>` and finally return true.<br />
If the Parking is in an invalid empty state, return false (and print nothing).

#### Save Data File function 
This function does not receive or return anything and if the Parking is not in an invalid empty state it prints:
`"Saving data into "` then prints the name of the data file followed by a `<NEWLINE>`.

### Public Methods

#### int Parking::run(); 

Run is the only public member function in Parking and runs the whole Parking Application exactly as stated in The Parking class overview section using the following functions calls and logic:

If the Parking is not in an invalid empty state:

1. The Run function calls the Parking Status function and then displays the Parking menu and waits for the user’s response.  
2. If any of menu options 1, 2, 3 or 4 are selected, it will call one of the Park Vehicle, Return Vehicle, List Parked Vehicles or findVehicle functions respectively and goes back to step **1**.
3. If menu option 5 is selected it will call the Close Parking function. If the Close Parking Function returns true it will exit and end the Run function. Otherwise, it goes back to step **1**.
4. If menu option 6 is selected it will call the Exit Parking App function and exits the Run function only if a true value is returned. Otherwise, it goes back to step **1**.

When Run exits, it should return 1 if the Parking is in an invalid empty state, otherwise, it should return 0. 

Note: As you see options 5 and 6 can both exit the program. In future implementations, there will be a difference between the two: 

Closing Parking is an end-of-the-day action; which results in towing all the remaining vehicles out of the parking since this is not an overnight parking application.

The Exit Program option acts as a pause in the application execution. In this case, the program (in future implementations) will save all its information in the data file and when it is executed again it will load all the data back and continue where it left off last time. 

### Other member functions:
-	Add other member functions to the Parking if needed.

## [Back to milestones](#milestones)

# Milestone 3
## Milestone 3.1
To continue with the project, we need to have an abstract base class to make our future Car and Motorcycle classes read/writable. We call this class ReadWritable

### The ReadWritable module:
Create a class called ReadWritable. ReadWritable class should force Read and Write capability to all its derived classes in two different ways; Comma Separated Values or Screen format. 

### The ReadWritable class implementation:
#### Comma Separated Values flag attribute
Add a bool flag as an attribute for the class to keep the stat of reading or writing the object in Comma Separated mode or not.

#### Other properties: 
Add other properties if, or when needed. 
### Constructor implementation:
- ReadWritable Has only a no-argument constructor that sets the Comma Separated Values flag to false.

### Destructor implementation:
- Create an empty virtual destructor for ReadWritable Class.

### Public Member function implementations:
-	bool isCsv()const;

    This query returns the Comma Separated Values flag;
-	void setCsv(bool value); 

    This function set the Comma Separated Values flag to the incoming bool value.
-	Read and Write 
    
    Create two pure virtual functions to read and write this object in future derived class implementations.
    The read and write function signatures have been described in milestone 1. 
    Helper insertion and extraction operator overloads for istream and ostream:
    
-	Implement the operator<< and operator>> to make any ReadWritable class Writable or Readable using ostream and istream.

### Other member functions:
-	Add other member functions to the ReadWritable class if needed.

## MS3.1 Tester program
Use this tester program to test your ReadWritable implementation. This will be part one of your milestone-3 main tester.

## Milestone 3.2

To build a valet parking application we need to create a class that encapsulates a Vehicle to be parked in a parking spot and can be retrieved when it is needed to be returned to the customer.

### The Vehicle module:
Derive a class called Vehicle from the ReadWritable abstract base class in milestone 3.1.

A Vehicle class should be able to store a license plate with a maximum of 8 characters, a make and model with an unknown length of minimum of two characters and a parking spot number that is an integer value. 

### The Vehicle class implementation:
> When implementing the methods of the class, you are responsible to recognize if a member function can change the state of the Vehicle or not. (i.e. if it is a constant function or not or if the arguments of a function are constants or not)

### Attributes
#### License plate 
A license plate can be 1 to 8 characters. 

Example: “ABC123”

#### Make and model
A make and model Cstring value with unknown length. This value can not be a null address and must be minimum of two characters.

Example: “Bmw 320 M” 

#### Parking spot number 
A parking spot number can be a zero or positive integer number. A Vehicle with a zero (0) parking spot number is considered a vehicle that is not parked.  

### Constructors
a Vehicle can be created using a no-argument constructor that sets the Vehicle to a safe Invalid empty state. Also, a Vehicle can be created using a license plate and a make and model value. In the latter case, the values are used to set the properties of the Vehicle and the parking spot is set to zero. If either of the licence plate or make and model are pointing to null or are invalid values, the Vehicle is set into an invalid empty state. 

### Rule of three
Make Sure a Vehicle is copied and assigned to another vehicle safely and also make sure there is no memory leach when going out of scope or deleted.

### Methods 
#### setEmpty
sets the Vehicle to an invalid empty state
#### isEmpty 
This function returns true if the Vehicle is in an invalid empty state, or else, it returns false.
#### getLicensePlate 
This function returns a read-only address of the license plate of the Vehicle.
#### getMakeModel
This function returns a read-only address of the make and model of the Vehicle.
#### setMakeModel
This function resets the make and model of the Vehicle to a new value. If the new value is null or empty, the object is set to an invalid empty state.
Public Member function and operator overload implementations:
#### getParkingSpot
This function returns the parking spot number of the Vehicle.
#### setParkingSpot
Resets the parking spot number to a new value. If the value is invalid, it will set the vehicle to an Invalid empty state.
#### operator==
Compares the license plate of the Vehicle with a license plate value and returns true if the two license plates are identical or else it returns false. This comparison is NOT case sensitive (i.e. “123ABC” is the same as “123abc”).

If any value is invalid, this function returns false;
#### operator==
Compares two Vehicles and if they have the same license plate, it will return true, or else it returns false. 
This comparison is NOT case-sensitive.

If any value is invalid, this function returns false;

#### read
This function overrides the Read of the ReadWritable class. 

If the vehicle is set to Comma Separated mode it will read as follows:
1.	It will read an integer for the parking spot number into the parking spot number
2.	It will ignore one character for the delimiter (comma ‘,’)
3.	It will read up to 8 characters or up to a comma character for the license plate and store it in the license plate number in all UPPERCASE. Either way, it will skip the comma afterwards.
4.	It will read up to 60 characters or up to a comma character delimiter for make and model and dynamically stores it in the make and model of the Vehicle. Either way, it will skip the comma afterwards.

If the Vehicle is not set to Comma Separated mode it will read as follows:

It will prompt on the screen:<br />
`"Enter Licence Plate Number: "`<br />
Then it will read up to 8 characters from the console. If the user enters more than 8 Characters, it will print the following error message and tries again until a proper license plate number is entered.<br />
`"Invalid Licence Plate, try again: "`<br />
Then it will prompt:<br />
`"Enter Make and Model: "`<br />
Afterwards, it will read 2 to 60 characters from the console. If the user enters a value with an invalid length, it will print the following error message and tries again until a proper make and model are entered.<br />
`"Invalid Make and model, try again: "`<br />
Then in any mode (comma separated or not), the Read function will check if the istream object failed while reading. If this was true it will set the Vehicle object to an invalid empty state.


Also, license plates are always stored as all UPPERCASE characters and the parking spot number is set to zero (0);

In the end, the istream object is returned.

#### writeType (pure virtual)
**writeType** receives and returns a reference of ostream.

This pure virtual method in future generations of Vehicle classes will print the type of Vehicle.

#### write
If the Vehicle is in an invalid empty state, this function will write the following message using the ostream object and returns it.

`"Invalid Vehicle Object"`

Otherwise, it will call the **writeType** method and if the class is in comma-separated mode, it will print the values of the parking spot, license plate and make and model, separated by commas and ending by a comma without going to newline. (i.e `12,ABC123,Bmw 320 M,` )

If the class is not in comma-separated mode, it will print the following using the ostream object:
1. `"Parking Spot Number: "` 
2. Parking spot number or "N/A" if the parking spot is zero
3. NEWLINE
4. `"License Plate: "`
5. Vehicle’s license plate
6. NEWLINE
7. `"Make and Model: "`
8. Vehicle’s Make and model
9. NEWLINE

write returns the ostream object at the end.

### Other member functions:
Add other member functions to the Vehicle class if needed.

## [Back to milestones](#milestones)


# Milestone 4

## Modification to Vehicle Access Specifiers 

Before starring your milestone 4 modify your Vehicle class and have the following functions under `protected` Access Specifier so they are only accessible by their Derived classes. 

- setEmpty
- isEmpty
- getLicensePlate
- getMakeModel
- setMakeModel

## Car and Motorcycle

The Valet Parking accepts two kinds of Vehicles; Car and Motorcycle.<br />
The Valet Parking also provides Carwash for the Cars, while they are parked in the parking.
It also allows Motorcycles with sidecars to be parked, but this option must be known when the Motorcycle is entering the Parking.

Inherit a Car and a Motorcycle class from the Vehicle class before the final stage of development of this project.

> :warning: Note: that it is possible, (but unlikely) that you may have to go back to milestone 4 and do minor modifications to Vehicle to make these classes work properly. 

## The Car module
Derive a class called Car from the Vehicle Class in milestone 3.2.

### The Car class implementation:

As done before, when implementing the member functions of the class, you are responsible to recognize if a member function can change the state of the class or not. (i.e. if it is a constant function or not or if the arguments of a function are constants or not)

#### Car Attributes 

Only one mandatory attribute is required for a Car:

##### Carwash flag attribute

In addition to what A Vehicle provides, a Car should be able to store having carwash during parking or not. 

#### Constructor implementation:

a Car can be created using a no-argument constructor that sets the Car (and therefore the Base class Vehicle) to a safe Invalid empty state. Also, a Car like its base class can be created using a license plate and a make and model value. In the latter case, the values are used to set the properties of the Vehicle. If one of the licence plates or make and model are pointing to null or if they are invalid values, the Car is set into an invalid empty state. 

#### Rule of three
A Car should be safely copied and assigned to another car. 

#### Member function implementations:

##### writeType
Override the pure virtual method `writeType` to write `"C,"` if the object is in comma-separated values format (isCsv()), or otherwise write `Vehicle type: Car"` and a NEWLINE.

##### Read
This function overrides the read method of the Vehicle class. 

If the Car is set to Comma Separated mode it will read as follows:
1.	It calls the read of the Base class;
2.	It reads a Boolean value (integer value of 1 or 0) into the carwash flag. 
3.	It ignores whatever character is left up to and including a newline character('\n').

If the Car is not set to Comma Separated mode it will read as follows:
1.	It will prompt on the screen:
`"Car information entry"` and prints a newline character.
2.	It will read the Base class.
3.	Then it will prompt: `"Carwash while parked? (Y)es/(N)o: "`
    
    Afterwards, it will wait for the user to enter a ‘Y’ or an ‘N’ (lowercase or uppercase) and based on the user’s response it will set the carwash flag to true or false respectively. 
    
    If the user responds with anything thing, other than a single character ‘y’ or ‘n’ it will keep printing:<br />
    `"Invalid response, only (Y)es or (N)o are acceptable, retry: "`<br />
    and waits for the user to try again.

    In the end, the istream object is returned.

#### Write
This function overrides the write method of the Vehicle class. 

If the Car is in an invalid empty state, this function will write the following message using the ostream object and returns the ostream object.<br />
`"Invalid Car Object"`

When the Car is not in an invalid empty state:

1.	It will write the base class.
2.	If the class is in comma-separated mode, it will print the carwash flag and goes to newline.
Otherwise based on the value of the carwash flag being true or false it will print 
`"With Carwash"` or `"Without Carwash"` respectively and then goes to newline.

At the end, the ostream object is returned.

## The Motorcycle module:

Derive a class called Motorcycle from the Vehicle Class in milestone 3.2.

### The Motorcycle class implementation:

As done before, when implementing the member functions of the class, you are responsible to recognize if a member function can change the state of the class or not. (i.e. if it is a constant function or not or if the arguments of a function are constants or not)

#### Motorcycle attributes

##### Has Sidecar flag attribute

In addition to what A Vehicle provides, a Motorcycle should be able to store if it has a sidecar attached or not.

#### Constructor implementation:
a Motorcycle can be created using a no-argument constructor that sets the Motorcycle ( and therefore the Base class Vehicle) to a safe Invalid empty state. Also, a Motorcycle like its base class can be created using a license plate and a make and model value. In the latter case, the values are used to set the properties of the Vehicle. If one of the licence plates or make and model are pointing to null or invalid values, the Motorcycle is set into an invalid empty state. 

#### Rule of three
A Motorcycle should be safely copied and assigned to another Motorcycle. 


### Member function implementations:

##### writeType
Override the pure virtual method `writeType` to write `"M,"` if the object is in comma-separated values format (isCsv()), or otherwise write `"Vehicle type: Motorcycle"` and a NEWLINE.

##### Read
This function overrides the read method of the Vehicle class. 

If the Motorcycle is set to Comma Separated mode it will read as follows:
1.	It calls the read of the Base class;
2.	It reads a Boolean value (integer value of 1 or 0) into the Has Sidecar flag. 
3.	It ignores whatever character is left up to and including a newline character('\n').

If the Motorcycle is not set to Comma Separated mode it will read as follows:
1.	It will prompt on the screen:
`"Motorcycle information entry"` and prints a newline character.
2.	It will read the Base class.
3.	Then it will prompt: `"Does the Motorcycle have a sidecar? (Y)es/(N)o: "`
    
    Afterwards, it will wait for the user to enter a ‘Y’ or an ‘N’ (lowercase or upper case) and based on the user’s response it will set the Has Sidecar flag to true or false respectively. 
    
    If the user responds with anything thing, other than a single character ‘y’ or ‘n’ it will keep printing:<br />
    `"Invalid response, only (Y)es or (N)o are acceptable, retry: "`<br />
    and waits for the user to try again.

    In the end, the istream object is returned.

#### Write
This function overrides the write method of the Vehicle class. 

If the Motorcycle is in an invalid empty state, this function will write the following message using the ostream object and returns the ostream object.<br />
`"Invalid Motorcycle Object"`

When the *~~Car~~* Motorcycle is not in an invalid empty state:

1.	It will write the base class.
2.	If the class is in comma-separated mode, it will print the Has Sidecar flag and goes to newline.
Otherwise, if the Has Sidecar flag is true it will print `"With Sidecar"` and then goes to newline.

In the end, the ostream object is returned.

## [Back to milestones](#milestones)


# Milestone 5

To complete your project for this semester, bring all the files in Milestones 2 and4 together into milestone 5. 

You will modify and complete the Parking module to implement a fully functional valet parking system as stated in milestone 2.

## The Parking module:
- **The Maximum Number of Parking Spots** Constant value:

    Add a constant integer value in the Parking module for the Maximum Number of Parking Spots and initialize it to the value 100.  

### Additional Mandatory Attributes: (member variables)

- **Number of Spots:**

    Add an **integer** property to the Parking class for **the Number of Spots**. This value is always less than or equal to the Maximum Number of Parking Spots constant value.

- **Parking Spots:**

    Create an array of Vehicle pointers that act like the Parking Spots in the Parking. Use the Maximum Number of Parking Spots constant value for the size of the array. 

### Additional Recommended Attributes: (member variables)

- **Number of Parked Vehicles**

    Add an integer property to the Parking for the Number of Parked Vehicles in the Parking. This value is always less than the `Number of Spots` Property.

### Constructor Modification:

```C++  
Parking( const char* datafile, int noOfSpots)
```
Add an integer (noOfSpots) argument added the Parking constructor. Set the value of the Number of Spots in the Parking to this value. This is the maximum number of Vehicles the Parking can accept. If this number is invalid (less than 10 or more than the Maximum Number of Parking Spots constant value) then the Parking is set as an Invalid Empty State. 

Also, make sure that all the elements of the Parking Spots array are initialized to nullptr.

The rest of the logic of the constructor remains the same as it was in milestone 2.

### The Parking Module Logic:

Before starting to implement the member functions. Let us clarify how the Parking class manages the Parking Sports Vehicle pointers array.

The following illustration shows how the Parking Spots array is used to keep track of the parked Vehicles in the Parking. 

![Parking Array](images/parking.png)

As a Vehicle arrives, a dynamic object of its type (Car or Motorcycle) will get created and set to the Vehicle’s specifications and the address of the object is kept in the next available (null) element of the Parking Spots array. 

You can keep track of the number of parked Vehicles in a member variable (**Number of Parked Vehicles**) so you can stop when it reaches the Number of Spots in the Parking.

If a Vehicle leaves the Parking, it is deallocated from the memory and the Parking Spot element pointing to it will be set back to nullptr which marks the Parking Spot empty again and ready for parking of the next arriving Vehicle.

## Private Parking method modifications and implementations
- **isEmpty()** function

  Remains the same as MS2
    
- **Parking Status** function 

    This function does not receive or return anything and prints the following:

    - `"****** Valet Parking ******"<NEWLINE>`
    - `"*****  Available spots: "`
    - In 4 spaces, left justified, it will print the number of available Parking Spots
    - `" *****"<NEWLINE>`

- **Load data-file** function 

  This function does not receive anything and returns a Boolean.
  
  Load Data reads Vehicle records from the data file and saves them in the corresponding Parking Spots indices.

    > you may use your own logic or follow these guidelines
    - Implementation guidelines: 
    
        If the Parking is not in an invalid empty state, using an instance of the ifstream class opens the file named in the Filename member variable.  
              
        If the opening of the file was not successful or the Parking was in an empty state (which means the Parking app is running for the first time) this function is in a good state (will return true when exits). 
  
        Otherwise, Loop through the records of the opened file and read each record into a vehicle pointer as follows:
  
        1. Extract one Character from the file and ignore the next. If the read fails, exit the loop since you are at the end of the data file.
    
             The extracted character should be either 'M' or 'C'; If the Character is 'M' create a dynamic instance of a Motorcycle and keep the address in the Vehicle pointer. Otherwise, If the Character is 'C' create a dynamic instance of a Car and keep the address in the Vehicle pointer (Hence, in any case; **M** or **C**, Vehicle should point to a Car or a Motorcycle). If the extracted character is not 'M' or 'C', let the Vehicle pointer remain nullptr.
     
        2. If either of the two Vehicles is allocated, then set the Vehicle to Comma Separate Value mode and extract its values from the data file. Since the read function is virtual, a car or motorcycle will be read from the file. Otherwise, set the function to a failure state (will return false when exits). 
  
        3. If the read was successful (Vehicle pointer is pointing to a Vehicle) add the Vehicle to the Parking by saving the Vehicle pointer in the element of the Parking Spot array that corresponds to the Parking Spot of the Vehicle (example: parking spot 5 is kept in element with index 4) otherwise if the read was unsuccessful deallocate the Vehicle and set the function to a false state and end the loop. 
  
        > Note that the index of the element of the Parking Spot array is always the Parking Spot number of the Vehicle minus one.
  
        Continue the loop while the number of records read is less than the number of elements of the array.
  
        At the end return the state of the function.

- **Save data-file** function 

    Using an instance of the ofstream class open the file named in the Filename member variable. 

    If the file is opened successfully go through all the elements of the Parking Spots that are not null and save the Vehicles pointed by them in the data file in Comma Separated mode.   

- **List Parked Vehicles** function 
  This function does not receive or return anything and goes through all the Parking Spot elements of the Parking (obviously up to the Number of Spots) and prints all that is not empty (not null) and separates them with the following line: `"-------------------------------"<NEWLINE>`

- **Find Vehicle** Function
  This function does not receive or return anything.

  Start by printing: `"Vehicle Search"<NEWLINE>` and then start the process by performing the following:
  
  Prompt the user for the license plate of the Vehicle that is to be returned:<br />
  `"Enter Licence Plate Number: "`<br />
  Receive the license plate value in a C-style character string between 1 to 8 characters. If the length if out of the license plate is less than 1 or more than 8 characters, print:<br />
  `"Invalid Licence Plate, try again: "`<br />
  and receive the value again.

  After receiving a valid license plate, search through the parked Vehicles for a matching license plate.

  If not found, print: `"License plate "` and then the **actual license plate value** and `" Not found"<NEWLINE>`
  
  If found, print `"Vechicle found:"<NEWLINE>` and print the Vehicle. 

- **Park Vehicle** function 

  This function does not receive or return anything.
 
  If there are no Parking Spots available, the function prints `"Parking is full"` and exits. Otherwise, the function displays the **Vehicle Selection** sub-menu and then based on the user’s selection performs the following:
  
  If the user selects Cancel, it will print `"Parking Cancelled"<NEWLINE>` and exits the function. Otherwise, it will dynamically create an instance of a Car or Motorcycle (based on the user’s selection) in a Vehicle pointer. Then it will set it NOT to be in Comma Separated mode and reads it from the console.
    
  After receiving the Vehicle information from the console, the function will search through the Parking Spots array and finds the first available (null) Parking Spot and sets it to the Vehicle pointer and also it will set the Parking Spot member variable of the Vehicle to the spot number it was parked in (index + 1) and prints the following: `"Parking Ticket"<NEWLINE>` and prints the Vehicle.

- **Return Vehicle** function 

  This function does not receive or return anything.

  Start by printing: `"Return Vehicle"<NEWLINE>` and then start the process by performing the following:
  
  Prompt the user for the license plate of the Vehicle that is to be returned:<br />
  `"Enter License Plate Number: "`<br />
  Receive the license plate value in a C-style character string between 1 to 8 characters. If the length if out of the license plate is less than 1 or more than 8 characters, print:<br />
  `"Invalid License Plate, try again: "`<br />
  and receive the value again.

  After receiving a valid license plate, search through the parked Vehicles for a matching license plate.

  If not found, print: `"License plate "` and then the **actual license plate value** and `" Not found"<NEWLINE>`
  
  If found, print `"Returning:"<NEWLINE>` and print the Vehicle. Then delete the Vehicle from the memory and set the Parking Spot element back to nullptr.
  
- **Close Parking** function 
  This function does not receive anything and returns a Boolean. 
  
  If the Parking is empty this function will print:<br />
  `"Closing Parking" <NEWLINE>`<br />
  Then exits the function returning true.
  
  Otherwise, this function first prints a confirmation message for the user as follows:<br />
  `"This will Remove and tow all remaining Vehicles from the Parking!"<NEWNLINE>`<br />
  `"Are you sure? (Y)es/(N)o: "`<br />
  And waits for the user to enter either “Y” or “N” (lowercase or uppercase). If the user enters an invalid response then prints:<br />
  `"Invalid response, only (Y)es or (N)o are acceptable, retry: "`<br />
  and repeats until the proper response is entered.

  If the user response is no, then the function exits returning false. Otherwise, it will first print<br />
  `"Closing Parking"<NEWLINE>`<br />
  it will go through all the parked Vehicles as follows:<br />
  1- Prints a towing ticket:<br />
  `"Towing request"<NEWLINE>`<br />
  `"*********************"<NEWLINE>`<br />
  2- Prints the Vehicle and skips a line.<br />
  3- Deletes the Vehicle and sets the Parking Spot to null until all the Vehicles are removed from the Parking.
  then returns true.
  
- Exit Parking App Function 
  
  This function remains the same as MS2.

## MS5 Submission


For marking see [Final Project Mark and Due dates](#final-project-mark-and-due-dates)

Upload all the source code , the tester program, the data files and your reflection (`reflect.txt`) to your `matrix` account. Compile and run your code using the `g++` compiler [as shown in the introduction](#compiling-and-testing-your-program) and make sure that everything works properly.

Then, run the submission commands stated in the 6 stages of submission from your account (replace `profname.proflastname` with your professor’s Seneca userid)

Each successful submission will earn you 10% of the prject mark (and with 4 submissions of milestones the total will be 100%)

### The submit program's options:

```bash
~prof_name.prof_lastname/submit DeliverableName [-submission options]<ENTER>
[-submission option] acceptable values:
  "-due":
       Shows due dates only
       This option cannot be used in combination with any other option.
  "-skip_spaces":
       Do the submission regardless of incorrect horizontal spacing.
       This option may attract penalty.
  "-skip_blank_lines":
       Do the submission regardless of incorrect vertical spacing.
       This option may attract penalty.
  "-feedback":
       Check the program execution without submission.
