# OOP244 - Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

This repository contains all of my code programs and work which I performed in the above mentioned course.

----------------------------------------
Course Description
----------------------------------------
After successful completion of this course, it helped me to...
```
  * introduce to object-oriented programming.
  * learn to build reusable objects, encapsulate data and logic
    within a class, inherit one class from another and implement polymorphism.
  * use the C++ programming language exclusively and establishes a foundation for
    learning system analysis and design and more advanced concepts as implemented
    in languages such as C++, Java, C# and Objective-C.
  * Design classes with dynamically allocated resources to model the components of a programming solution
  * Design member functions using logic constructs to solve tasks of linear complexity
  * Relate classes using inheritance hierarchies to minimize the duplication of object code
  * Design polymorphic objects to amplify the reusability of program code
  * Use stream objects to interact with users and access persistent data
  * Trace the execution of object-oriented code to validate its correctness
  * Code a complete program using polymorphic objects to solve a systems or business problem
  * Explain the purpose of an object-oriented programming feature to inform a business person
  * Execute mathematical operations accurately.
  * Apply a systematic approach to solve problems.
  * Use a variety of thinking skills to anticipate and solve problems.
  * Locate, select, organize, and document information using appropriate technology and information systems.
  *  Analyze, evaluate, and apply relevant information from a variety of sources.
  * Take responsibility for one's own actions, decisions, and consequences.
